##Django Rest Framework
Serializers: package and unpackage data
Package when going to the server , and unpackage data when coming from the server


what We need to do with the rest framework is that
we need a way to get this data and output it in a way that can be read by other technologies like other mobile applications
Response ka jawab aayega in a format that can be read by other technologies.

Need a JSON version of all this data
JSON Format

Thats what a serializer does: It takes the data that exists on the server and it serializes it in an output
that can be read by other technologies,  (JSON Type)
Package bhejte hue

Two types of Serializers :
Model and Regular(general)
General wala long way but more customizable
Model wale less customizable but more simple to set up

We will separate the rest api code
Regular code for the server and then there is a Rest Api Code
Model Serializer with the Rest Framework and now we are gonna make a view to display that serialized data
Serializer bna liya, ab view bnayenge to display that serialized data from the server

Ab bnayenge Function based view
 Abhi tak bas view tha
 now update, and other features from the REST API Krke dekhenge, create, delete
 PUT DELETE POST Requests

 Update krna serializer just like the form functionality


View aayega: DJango Rest Framework constructs this view for us
Build Rest APIs on Top of Django Framework
REST: Representative State Transfer

Till now we were using HTTP for getting any documents from the server, maybe some kind of pages ,
same http protocols.
